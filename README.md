# Parallel_Computing
Content about CSCE 735 - Parallel Computing. Involve a major project with Strassen's algorithm on matrix multiplication and several assignments implementing parallel methodology on general algorithms.

## Strassen's Algorithm with OpenMP
Strassen's algorithm accelerates matrix multiplication from O(n<sup>3</sup>) to O(n<sup>2.8</sup>).
